# Static-Site
Custom CSS Static Site

I made this webpage to practice designing modular and flexable static pages

This helped me better understand the value of static designs using centered content with buffer whitespace on either side

I used javascript for the login and sign up box that appears when you click either button in the top right. The javascript makes the box appear, and stay there unless the user clicks outside of the box, in which case the box disappears again

The login/signup functionality isn't implemented with this page only because I made the site to gain experience with static page creation, not database usage and/or the implementation of user account functionality

I animated the white lines on either side of every button using before and after effects on the elements, manipulating opacity and height on hover/mouse-over

For the home button on the top left, I used two pictures and transition between them on hover/mouse-over. Both pictures I created myself with adobe illustrator swapping color positions of the two for continuity and noticability
I also have the home button "pop" into the shaded part of the header when resizing the width of the window smaller than 1390px. I do this by using two different home buttons, one is visible while the other isn't, giving the illusion that it's the same home button moving or "popping" into place

For the body background, I chose a fixed background attachment, as well as making the overall content container translucent, to give the impression that the webpage's content is skating over a window pane overlooking a landscape. This effect, in my opinion, makes the page feel like it has more visual depth and isn't as claustrophobic feeling as one with a one dimensional background
